# Typing Speed Test (OOP Version)
This project is inspired by a procedural implementation from **[PythonGeeks.org](https://pythongeeks.org/python-typing-test-project/)**. I used it as a starting point and completely restructured the code using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to meet the requirements of this final project.

# Features

- Choose difficulty level: **Easy**, **Medium**, or **Hard**
- Calculates **Words Per Minute (WPM)** and **Accuracy**
- Allows retyping incorrect words until correct
- Timer-based (default: 60 seconds)
- Built using **Tkinter** and written in **Object-Oriented Python**
